Other than the three main projects, Castle consists of a whole range of smaller, but very useful libraries that you can take advantage of in your application.

## Logging

[Logging Services](logging.md) - logging abstractions and implementations for common scenarios and logging frameworks.

## DynamicProxy

[Castle DynamicProxy](dynamicproxy.md) - a lightweight, lightning fast framework for generating proxies on the fly, used extensively by multiple projects within Castle (Windsor, MonoRail) and outside of it (NHibernate, Rhino Mocks, AutoMapper and many others).

## DictionaryAdapter

[Castle DictionaryAdapter](dictionaryadapter.md) - on the fly generates strongly typed wrappers around untyped dictionaries, or chunks of XML (like config file), optionally adding support for change notification, cancelation, error notification and other features.

## Scheduler

[Castle Scheduler](scheduler.md) - a lightweight job scheduling service.
