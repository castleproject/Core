beta 4
======

- Fixed AR-52 - Dont allow one to invoke Initialize more than once

- Added some flexibility into ActiveRecord Queries. They are now mutable,
  which means we now have methods like 'SetParameter', 'SetParameterList' and
  'SetRange'; and the 'Query' property is now read-write.

- Added support for query modifiers in ActiveRecord Queries. Any object implementing
  IQueryModifier can be added to an ActiveRecordBaseQuery, using the 
  (protected) 'AddModifier' method. Parameters and query ranges 
  are implemented as query modifiers.

- Fixed AR-39: Added virtual to IsValid on ActiveRecordValidationBase/<T>

- Fixed AR-45: Added BindingFlags.NonPublic to DefaultBindingFlags on ActiveRecordModelBuilder

- Added Element to RelationAttribute, now can map relations of simple types
   Usage:
	 [HasMany(typeof(string), "ItemId", "Elements", Element = "Name")]

- Applied Antonio`s patches 
  See http://forum.castleproject.org/posts/list/457.page and 
      http://forum.castleproject.org/posts/list/566.page

- Added Debug to IConfiguration Source. If set then XmlGenerationVisitor will save nhibernate mapping files to the AppDomain.BaseDirectory. 

- Added support to CompositeKeys as Foreign Keys (kudos to G. Richard Bellamy)

  BelongsToAttribute - Added CompositeKeyColumns property.
  HasAndBelongsToManyAttribute - Added CompositeKeyColumnKeys and CompositeKeyColumnRefs.
  HasManyAttribute - Added CompositeKeyColumnKeys.
  VersionAttribute - Added support for UnsavedValue.
  SemanticVerifierVisitor - Added checks to ensure the composite key attributes are used properly.
  XmlGenerationVisitor - Added output to support mapping the composite key attributes, as well as the unsaved-value attribute for Version.
 
  In general, the changes are motivated by the need to have AR map to 
  legacy data, where composite keys are used as both primary and foreign 
  keys. The current AR support for CompositeKeys does not support 
  associations, this patch does.
 
  There are some caveats when using this, which are driven by the NH 
  implementation. An assigned identifier (like all CompositeKeys and 
  many string PrimaryKeys) cannot be used to determine whether an instance 
  is detached or transient - since it's assigned by the application, it's 
  never null. Therefore, you must use another strategy, NH will misbehave 
  around the way it persists the instance to the database. That is why the 
  VersionAttribute had to have the support for UnsavedValue - the UnsavedValue 
  property of the Version is used by NH to determine the state of the instance.
 
  For a discussion of the appropriate mappings and usage, see "Hibernate in Action," pgs. 330 - 335.

- Added SessionScopeWebModule which hooks BeginRequest and EndRequest initializing and 
  destructing a SessionScope properly. In order to use it add to httpModules section 
  (web.config):
  
  <system.web>
    <httpModules>
      <add name="ar.sessionscope" type="Castle.ActiveRecord.Framework.SessionScopeWebModule, Castle.ActiveRecord" />
    </httpModules>
  </system.web>

- Added lifecycle methods that can be overriden:

  . OnSave
  . OnUpdate
  . OnLoad(id)
  . OnDelete

- Applied patch from Ahmed Ghandour <aghandour@rydexinvestments.com> adding the methods
  FetchCount and Exists to ActiveRecordBase

- Applied patch from Dave Godfrey fixing nested classes with relations problems (http://forum.castleproject.org/posts/list/457.page)

- Fixed a stack overflow exception when using IsUnique inside a session scope.

- You can now apply IsUnique to a property that also has PrimaryKey on it without problem.

- Resolved IsUnique bug with ActiveRecordValidationBase<> (it was non functional)

- Resolved test bugs with IsUnique for .net 1 and .net 2.

- Refactored query support:
  - Introduced generic interface IActiveRecordQuery<T>, extending IActiveRecordQuery, for strongly-typed Execute() method support;
  - Added IActiveRecordQuery.Enumerate(), for memory-intensive queries;
  - Introduced HqlBasedQuery, decoupling ActiveRecordBaseQuery from HQL usage;

- Added ValidateCreditCard validation attribute.

- Added ValidateLength validation attribute.

- Added support for .Net 2.0 Connection Strings in the config file, using this method:

<activerecord>
	<add key="hibernate.connection.connection_string" value="ConnectionString = ${ConnectionStringKey}" />
</activerecord>

<connectionStrings>
	<add name="ConnectionStringKey" connectionString="The Connection String"/>
</connectionStrings>

This allows to take advantage of the connection string encryption as well as manage them using the built in tools.

- Added Exists<PkType>(PkType id) support to allow for checking of an object's existance 
  in the datastore.

- Brought ActiveRecordBase.Generic inline with ActiveRecordBase feature wise.  
  Public Static Methods are now present on all ActiveRecordBase.Generic objects for common tasks such as Find, FindAll, etc.

  <This is a breaking change.>
  
- Added support for NHibernate dynamic-update, dynamic-insert to ActiveRecordAttribute

- Simplified NHibernate markup generation for testing

  Attributes are now written in one of two ways. Tags that have both an open and close 
  will have no space at the end of the attributes on the opening tag, while tags that 
  have no contents (<tag />) will be written with one space after the last attribute.
  
  Examples:
  
  <openclose attrib="test" attrib2="test"></openclose>
  
  <noclosetag attrib="test"/>

- Added ActiveRecordValidationBase<> to support validation on Generic AR classes

- Updated DeleteAll(Type targetType, IEnumerable pkValues) to support non int primary keys

- Add more hookable methods.

- Refactored Validation support to use NHibernate.IValidatable

- Brought ActiveRecordMediator.Generic inline with ActiveRecordMediator.  This is a breaking 
  change (removal of a few methods/renaming of a few existing).

- Add import support (kudos to Dan Burnea)
  [ActiveRecord, Import(typeof(ImportClassRow), "ImportClassRow")]
  public class ImportClass : ActiveRecordBase

beta 3
======

- Added FindAllByProperty, FindFirst and FindOne

- Added DeleteAll(type, where) (kudos to G. Richard Bellamy)

- Applied patch from Josh Robb. Added support for hooks on ActiveRecordBase<T>.

- DifferentDatabaseScope: so you can open a session using a different dbconnection
  and persist your object model. Very experimental version

- Fixed: Support for multiple databases was completely broken.

- An implementation of ISessionFactoryHolder can be specified through the configuration, attribute sessionfactoryholdertype
  on the config node.

- Added: ActiveRecordBase<T> - a generic form a ActiveRecordBase which relieves the need to re-write
  all the base static methods to hide the type parameter and cast the result. Generics do it for you.

- Added: ActiveRecordStarter.CreateSchemaFromFile(filename) as an alternative to CreateSchema. 

- Added: Support for composite keys - composite key class must be serializable and implement both Equals and GetHashCode.
  Not complete support, missing the NHibernate key-many-to-one element in the composite key.
  
- Added: Support for Lazy loading class using BelongsTo. Will throw if there is a non virtual property that
  also BelongsTo().

- Closed: (AR-24) ValidationException must contain the validation error messages

- Support for fields in addition to properties

- Added [Any], [Any.MetaValue] and [HasManyToAny] attributes.

- Small improvement on ActiveRecordModelBuilder (less intensive on IsDefined/GetCustomAttribute)

- IThreadScopeInfo introduced. Two implementations: ThreadScopeInfo and WebThreadScopeInfo. 
  ThreadScopeInfo is the default implementation. You can use WebThreadScopeInfo by simply using 
  isWeb="true" on the configuration node:
  
  <config isWeb="true">
    ..
  
  Or you can provide your own implementation specifying the full type name

  <config threadinfotype="my.threadinfotype, my.assembly">
    ..

beta 2
======

- Transaction support: lots of minor fixes

- Added support for map relations. 
  Necessary to specify Index and IndexType on the HasMany (or HasAndBelongsToMany)
