Where to start the build if you are an end-user?
=========================

Use the enduser.cmd script, which drives default.build, in the root directory. It compiles everything in the right order, copies dependencies and so on.
It is necessary to build the trunk in this way before attempting to load any solutions in your IDE for the first time, otherwise you may have reference problems:

Simply type

  > enduser
This will create a Debug build of the project, without running the tests/hitting databases or accessing the GAC.


Where to start the build if you consider yourself a poweruser?
=========================

Use the build.cmd, which drives default.build, in the root directory. It compiles everything in the right order, copies dependencies and so on.

Simply type

  > build
This will create a Debug build of the project
******
****** Please note that for this script to succeed you need to have the necessary databases set up, and be allowed to put assemblies in the GAC. 
****** Please, please read this whole file carefully.

Use the following to build the trunk before attempting to load any solutions in your IDE for the first time, otherwise you may have reference problems:

  > build quick rebuild
This will create a Debug build of the project, without running the tests/hitting databases or accessing the GAC.


Database tests
==============

If you have MS SQL Server installed (default instance) just create two databases:

- test
- test2

If not, and you want to run the database tests, you must set the connection string, dialect and driver through NAnt defines. Otherwise you can disable the tests (see below).

The basic NHibernate settings can be set as NAnt arguments:

- ar.dialect sets the NHibernate dialect

    > -D:ar.dialect=NHibernate.Dialect.MsSql2000Dialect

- ar.connection.driver_class sets the driver

    > -D:ar.connection.driver_class=NHibernate.Driver.SqlClientDriver

- ar.connection.connection_string{1,2} set the connection strings for the test and test2 databases

    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.1="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=test;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.2="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=test2;Integrated Security=SSPI;"


Possible problem with 3.5
=========================
if you get the following error: 
"The SDK for the 'net-3.5' framework is not available or not configured."
then you probably need to fix the sdkInstallRoot in your nant.exe.config file to point to the correct location in the registry
See the following article for more info:
http://www.timbarcz.com/blog/NantSetupForVisualStudio2008AndNet35.aspx


Possible problem with WCF facility build
========================================

If you bump into the following message "System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException : The TransportManager failed to listen on the supplied URI using the NetTcpPortSharing service: failed to start the service because it is disabled. An administrator can enable it by running 'sc.exe config NetTcpPortSharing start= demand'

Run the following from the command line:

> sc.exe config NetTcpPortSharing start= demand


MSDTC
=====
The Distributed Transaction Coordinator (msdtc) is required for some of the tests.
If the service is not running by default on your machine, you'd need to start it to make tests pass
so, simply start it before running the build, and stop it afterwards:

    > net start msdtc
    > build ...
    > net stop msdtc


Build options
=============

Build option selectors
------------------------

Selectors are pseudo-targets, used to configure some part of the build.
They need to be put before real build targets.

debug:		"build debug build" will build the project in debug configuration"
release:	"build release rebuild" will rebuild the entire project in release configuration
quick: 		"build quick build" will run the build without tests and generally will try to skip as much as possible to speed up the build.


Running the tests
-------------------
It's strongly advised to use the NUnit console test runner (nunit-console.exe) for running the tests.
If you do not have NUnit installed the build script will fall back to using NAnt's <nunit2> task, which may or may not work for you.
The build will search for nunit-console.exe on the path, in case you don't have it on the path you can specify it's location by
setting the NAnt property -D:nunit-console=<full path to nunit-console.exe>.

Building without running the tests
-------------------

  > build -D:common.testrunner.enabled=false

Compiling a version not strongly signed
---------------------------------------

  > build -D:sign=false

 
Allowing partial trust
----------------------

  > build -D:assembly.allow-partially-trusted-callers=true
