Everything should compile fine using NAnt 0.85 final. 
You can find the latest version at http://nant.sourceforge.net/ 

Anyway, the following are some useful tips if things go wrong for some reason.

Where to start the build?
=========================

Use the default.build in the root directory. It compiles everything in the right order, copies dependencies and so on.

Simply type

  > nant
This will create a Debug build of the project

Use the following to build the trunk before attempting to load any solutions in your IDE for the first time, otherwise you may have reference problems:

  > nant rebuild, or
  > nant quick rebuild


Database tests
==============

If you have MS SQL Server installed (default instance) just create two databases:

- test
- test2

If not, and you want to run the database tests, you must set the connection string, dialect and driver through NAnt defines. Otherwise you can disable the tests (see below).

The basic NHibernate settings can be set as NAnt arguments:

- ar.dialect sets the NHibernate dialect

    > -D:ar.dialect=NHibernate.Dialect.MsSql2000Dialect

- ar.connection.driver_class sets the driver

    > -D:ar.connection.driver_class=NHibernate.Driver.SqlClientDriver

- ar.connection.connection_string{1,2} set the connection strings for the test and test2 databases

    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.1="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=test;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
    > -D:ar.connection.connection_string.2="Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=test2;Integrated Security=SSPI;"
  
Build options
=============

Build option selectors
------------------------

Selectors are pseudo-targets, used to configure some part of the build.
They need to be put before real build targets.

debug:		"nant debug build" will build the project in debug configuration"
release:	"nant release rebuild" will rebuild the entire project in release configuration
quick: 		"nant quick build" will run the build without tests and generally will try to skip as much as possible to speed up the build.


Disabling all tests
-------------------

  > nant -D:common.testrunner.enabled=false

Selecting a different test framework (EXPERIMENTAL)
-------------------

NUnit (default)
  > nant -D:testrunner=NUnit

MbUnit:
  > nant -D:testrunner=MbUnit

N.B.
MbUnit or NUnit needs to be on the path, alternatively you can specify the test runner console location by
setting the properties -D:mbunit-console=<path to MBUnit.Cons.exe> or 
-D:nunit-console=<path to nunit-console.exe> respectively.


Compiling a version not strongly signed
---------------------------------------

  > nant -D:sign=false

 
Allowing partial trust
----------------------

  > nant -D:assembly.allow-partially-trusted-callers=true


Building the Castle MSI installer
----------------------

  > nant installer
  
You need to have installed the tools following for running this task:
