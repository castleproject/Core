RC 4
====

- Fixed IOC-43 
  "Creation of an Attribute in the Kernel that allows one property to be ignored by the dependency builder"
  
  Introduced DoNotWireAttribute that marks a property and prevents it
  from being considered by the container

- Changed Windsor to use DynamicProxy 2

- Applied patch by Adam Mills fixing IOC-42
  "ResolveServices", new method added to IKernel

- Applied patch by Adam Mills fixing IOC-41
  "Bug Fix BinaryTreeComponentName - Assumed Lesser nodes went to left"

- Applied patch by Adam Mills fixing IOC-40
  "Provided an Implementation for BinaryTreeComponentName.Remove"

- Applied patch by Adam Mills fixing IOC-39
  "Fix for Null Reference when accessing empty BinaryTreeComponentName"

- Fixed IOC-35 
  "Add bootstrap section to configuration file"

- Fixed issue where KeyAlreadyAdded exception would be throw for 
  components accepting two parameters of the same type, without overrides

- Fixed IOC-36 
  "Transient components with multliple constructors throw 
   unresolved dependency exceptions."

  Removed best candidate reference, as the kernel is dynamic it should
  not cache best constructors as components can be added or removed
  at any time
  
  Removed Points from candidates, as in a multithreaded scenario
  this would lead to failures
  

- Fixed IOC-34 
  "Cannot use types having their own base type as constructor argument"

  See revision r2787

- IOC-32, Support generic collections. 
  Supported collections are: ICollection<T>, IList<T>, List<T>, IDictionary<K,V>, Dictionary<K,V>, IEnumerable<T> 

RC 3
====
 
- Applied patch by William C. Pierce <wcpierce@gmail.com> adding PerWebRequestAttribute

- Added setter to ReleasePolicy property

- Applied Curtis Schlak's patch fixing IOC-30
  "Add overload to Windsor AddComponent to specify the Lifestyle"

- Refactored AbstractHandler to use IDependencyResolver

- Dependencies can be resolved now in three levels:

  * CreationContext (which now implements ISubDependencyResolver)
  * IHandler (which now implements ISubDependencyResolver)
  * IKernel which is the normal flow

- Implemented IoC-29 using a different approach

- Renamed IKernel.AddComponentWithProperties to AddComponentWithExtendedProperties.
  The old method name misled the programmer about its purpose.

- Added a PerWebRequestLifestyleManager which creates at most one instance of
  an object per web request.  To use it you must add the following http module

  <httpModules>
      ...
	  <add name="PerWebRequest" type="Castle.MicroKernel.Lifestyle.PerWebRequestLifestyleManager , Castle.MicroKernel,Version=0.0.1.7, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=407dd0808d44fbdc"/>

  <httpModules>

  The strong name could be omitted if not in the GAC

- Added checks to handle cycles in dependencies graphs and avoid deadly Stack Overflow Exceptions.

- Fixed IOC-24: "Allow user to provide an attribute which will customize how to inspect properties (PropertiesDependenciesModelInspector)"
  Now users can add an 'inspectionBehavior' attribute to the component node that defines
  the inspection strategy. Possible values are
  
  - None: No properties inspection should happen
  - All: All properties will be inspected and collected (on the class and on the superclasses). 
         This is the default behavior
  - DeclaredOnly: Only properties specified on type are checked (superclasses will be ignored) 

- Added overload to ITypeConvertor that accept the current node configuration as well as the type in CanHandleType()

- Change: Better error message when there's an exception 
  setting up properties

- Fixed IOC-25: Overrides on the configuration should be considered a non-optional dependency

  This fix changes a little the MicroKernel behavior. Now if you specify an service override
  through external configuration, it will be considered a _non-optional_ dependency

- Uri usage replaced by CustomUri which, differently than MS' Uri class, has the same
  behavior on net-1.1, net-2.0 and mono

- EventWiring Facility: now when a publisher is requested, the subscribers
  are automatically started. 
  
  The side effects are: 
  
  - when a subscriber is requested it won't be wired automatically. 
  - There no much sense in having a subscriber with a lifestyle other than singleton
  
  I'm still evaluating this idea. Sometimes wiring only when the subscriber is requested
  might make sense, but supporting both approaches is kinda hard.
  

- Applied patch by Alex Henderson <webmaster@bittercoder.com> adding
    IWindsorContainer.RemoveChildContainer(IWindsorContainer childContainer)
    and IKernel.RemoveChildKernel(IKernel kernel)

- Applied fix by Ahmed. Now defines can be used on properties nodes like

  <properties>
   <?if DEBUG?>
    <item>x</item>
   <?end?>
  </properties>

- Now with DictionaryConverter you can specify the keyType and valueType on each entry (kudos to Ahmed)

- xmlinterpreter will throw an exception if a property is not defined but referenced
using #{propertyName} syntax.(Patch from Ahmed)

- XmlProcessor refactored from XmlInterpreter (kudos to Ahmed)
  Now PI are also supported (don't forget to document this on the wiki)

- Support for nested nodes on the properties. (kudos to Ahmed)
  Example:

  <configuration>
    <properties>
       <MyComponentParams>
         <user>Joe</user>
         <pwd>Doe</pwd>
       </MyComponentParams>
     </properties>
     <components id=”MyComponent”>
       <parameters>#{ MyComponentParams }</parameters>
     </components>
  </configuration>
  
  Will result in 

     <components id=”MyComponent”>
       <parameters>
         <user>Joe</user>
         <pwd>Doe</pwd>
       </parameters>
     </components>

- Type converter for kernel components. This allows a usage like this:

  <component id="mycomp">
  
    <parameters>
      <servicelist>
        <list type="IMyService, MyAssembly">
          <item>${keytocomponent1}</item>
          <item>${keytocomponent2}</item>
        </list>
      </servicelist>
    </parameters>

- Removed support for MethodMeta on ComponentModel. The design decision here 
  is to make the facilities interested on it to extend MethodMetaInspector
  reading from a specific node.

RC 2
====

- AsyncInitializationContainer introduced. Special container flavor that installs the
  facilities and components using a background thread.

- Support for evaluation of expressions within the xml configuration (kudos to Ahmed)
  The following "statements" are supported:
  
	<define flag="DEBUG" />
	<undef flag="DEBUG"/>
	
	<if defined="DEBUG">
		component/facility nodes
	</if>
	
	<choose>
		<when defined="DEBUG">
			<component id="debug"/>
		</when>
		<when defined="Qa">
			<component id="qa"/>
		</when>
		<when defined="Prod">
			<component id="prod"/>
		</when>
		<otherwise>
			<component id="default"/>
		</otherwise>
	</choose>

- Startable facility: support to specify the attribute startable=true on the configuration

- Better error messages: now the components waiting for dependencies will recursively 
  report what they are waiting for.

- Support for custom lifestyle through configuration (kudos to Bawer Dagdeviren):

  <component id="my.component"
                   type="MyLib.MyComponent, MyLib"
                   lifestyle="custom"
                   customLifestyleType="MyLib.MyCustomLifestyle, MyLib" />

- Added Type converter for enums

- Support to associate configuration nodes to methods. Usage:

	<component>
		<methods>
			<save />
			<save signature="System.String, mscorlib" />
			<save signature="System.String, mscorlib;System.Int32, mscorlib" />
		</methods>
	</component>

  Which is equivalent to

	<component>
		<methods>
			<method name="save" />
			<method name="save" signature="System.String, mscorlib" />
			<method name="save" signature="System.String, mscorlib;System.Int32, mscorlib" />
		</methods>
	</component> 

- IResource introduced (FileResource, AssemblyResource, ConfigResource and UncResource)
  which are accessible through Uris:

  - FileResource:  
    file://pathtofile 
    (For example: file://c:\mydir\file.txt)

  - AssemblyResource:  
    assembly://AssemblyName/ExtendingNamespace/filename 
    (For example: assembly://Castle.Windsor.Tests/Configuration2/include1.xml)

  - ConfigResource:  
    config://sectioname 
    (For example: config://castle will fetch the 
    <configuration><castle> entry in the configuration)

  - UncResource:  
    \\server\file 
    (For example: \\mysharedplace\myconfig.xml)

- IResource, IResourceFactory and IResourceSubSystem introduced

- Ability to use <properties> in configuration files. Usage

	<properties>	
		<prop1>prop1 value</prop1>
		<prop2>prop2 value</prop2>
	</properties>

	<facilities>
	
		<facility id="testidengine" >
			<item>#{prop1}</item>
		</facility>

		<facility id="testidengine2" >
			<item value="#{prop2}"/>
		</facility>
	
	</facilities>


- Ability to use <include> in configuration files. Usage

  Main file:

	<configuration>

		<include uri="file://include1.xml"/>

	</configuration>

  include1.xml:

	<configuration>

		<components>

			<component id="testidcomponent1">
			</component>

			<component id="testidcomponent2">
			</component>

		</components>

	</configuration>
