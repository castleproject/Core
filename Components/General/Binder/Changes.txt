Beta 2
======

- Added a CanConvert and an additional Convert

- Added check for duplicate fields in DataReaderAdapter. 

- DataReaderAdapter: Added support for TypeConverters

- Added two events to IDataBinder:

  BinderHandler OnBeforeBinding;
  BinderHandler OnAfterBinding;

- Changed to allow null inputs be passed to type converters

- Changed ConvertUtils behavior. Now empty strings will be converted to null 
  and conversionSucceeded = true. Also, string will be trimmed.

- Introduced DataReaderAdapter which can be used to populate an object based
  on an IDataReader. The adapter does not take ownership of the reader

  Example:
  
    DataBinder binder = new DataBinder();

    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Server=(local);initial catalog=mydatabase;Integrated Security=SSPI");

    conn.Open();

    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("select * from products", conn);

    using(IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
    {
        Product[] products = (Product[])
            binder.BindObject(typeof(Product[]), "ignored", 
                new DataReaderAdapter(reader));
    }


  Limitations: only simple properties can be bound. Nested properties are ignored.


- IBinderTranslator: after introducing the DataReaderAdapter, it was necessary 
  create the notion of translation. A translator takes the a property name and
  returns the key that the binder should look up in order to get the value to fill
  the property. The translator can also return null. In this case the binder will skip
  the property
  
  A translator is associated with a Binder instance (which I'm not quite sure is a good thing)
  
  Example:

    DataBinder binder = new DataBinder(new ProductTranslator());

    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Server=(local);initial catalog=mydatabase;Integrated Security=SSPI");

    conn.Open();

    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("select nome, descricao from produtos", conn);

    using(IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
    {
        Product[] products = (Product[])
            binder.BindObject(typeof(Product[]), "ignored", 
                new DataReaderAdapter(reader));
    }
    
  ...
    
    public class ProductTranslator : IBinderTranslator
    {
        public String Translate(Type instanceType, String paramName)
        {
            if (paramName == "Name")
            {
              return "nome"; // this is the db column name
            }
            else if (paramName == "Address")
            {
              return "address"; // this is the db column name
            }
            
            return null;
        }
    }


Beta 1
======

- Fix conversion using TypeConverters. The Converter won't be invoked if 
  the input is null.

- The binder was extracted from MonoRail code base.
