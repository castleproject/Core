Beta 2
======

- Fixed MR-383
  "Databinding object with non-public constructor"
  Added ability to create types with non-public constructors. Not sure I like it, but...

- Changed DefaultConversion behavior: empty string is now considered 
  a non succeeded conversion. It used to be considered successful returning false. 

  This might be a breaking change!


- Applied Brian Chan's patch fixing MR-282
  "Binding to a nested IList<> or not null nested List<> fails"

- Applied Adam Tybor's patch fixing MR-289
  "Array Binding for Prototype Style Serialization"

- Applied Adam Tybor's patch fixing MR-266
  "Fix for GetErrorSummary() throwing an KeyNotFoundException for SmartDispatch Controller and Binder"

- Fixed COMP-27
  "Validators in a Chain - ValidateNonEmpty fails with BelongsTo"

- Changed DefaultConverter behavior:
  
  -> If we are dealing with a primitive, non-null values will always
     set conversionSuceeded to true
     That's because the value was on the form, and the binder needs to set it
  
  -> If we are dealing with a nullable, the conversionSuceeded will be set to true
     if the nested conversion succeeds or if the input is different from null.

- Fixed COMP-8: Converter is not able to deal with Nullables<>

- Fixed COMP-6: Nullable boolean cannot be bound

- Updated to check argument inheritance for conversions.

- Resolved COMP-3: Add support for generic collections.

- Fixed MR-164: Allow and Exclude property acts on all objects, in any depth.

- Applied patch by Lee Henson fixing MR-179
  "Binder doesn't convert empty strings to null."

- Fixed bug that wrongly defined empty strings as conversionSucceeded = false

- Fixed COMP-1 "Binder fails on simple MonoRail binding, when using ASP.NET authentication"
  Now the TreeBuilder will add as a leaf entries starting with '.', or '[' or ']'

- Applied patch from Ernst Naezer's fixing a situation where the prefix is composed
  like "node1.node2.node3"

- Removed support for meta elements (as they were passed 
    via get/form and that doesn't look very safe)

- More test cases were added

- Major refactoring on Graph design and interfaces. However there wasn't any big change 
  on the DataBinder class itself.

- Changed ConvertUtils to consider non successful an attempt to convert a null 
  value to boolean

- Added a CanConvert and an additional Convert

- Added check for duplicate fields in DataReaderAdapter. 

- DataReaderAdapter: Added support for TypeConverters

- Added two events to IDataBinder:

  BinderHandler OnBeforeBinding;
  BinderHandler OnAfterBinding;

- Changed to allow null inputs be passed to type converters

- Changed ConvertUtils behavior. Now empty strings will be converted to null 
  and conversionSucceeded = true. Also, string will be trimmed.

- Introduced DataReaderAdapter which can be used to populate an object based
  on an IDataReader. The adapter does not take ownership of the reader

  Example:
  
    DataBinder binder = new DataBinder();

    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Server=(local);initial catalog=mydatabase;Integrated Security=SSPI");

    conn.Open();

    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("select * from products", conn);

    using(IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
    {
        Product[] products = (Product[])
            binder.BindObject(typeof(Product[]), "ignored", 
                new DataReaderAdapter(reader));
    }


  Limitations: only simple properties can be bound. Nested properties are ignored.


- IBinderTranslator: after introducing the DataReaderAdapter, it was necessary 
  create the notion of translation. A translator takes the a property name and
  returns the key that the binder should look up in order to get the value to fill
  the property. The translator can also return null. In this case the binder will skip
  the property
  
  A translator is associated with a Binder instance (which I'm not quite sure is a good thing)
  
  Example:

    DataBinder binder = new DataBinder(new ProductTranslator());

    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection("Server=(local);initial catalog=mydatabase;Integrated Security=SSPI");

    conn.Open();

    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("select nome, descricao from produtos", conn);

    using(IDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection))
    {
        Product[] products = (Product[])
            binder.BindObject(typeof(Product[]), "ignored", 
                new DataReaderAdapter(reader));
    }
    
  ...
    
    public class ProductTranslator : IBinderTranslator
    {
        public String Translate(Type instanceType, String paramName)
        {
            if (paramName == "Name")
            {
              return "nome"; // this is the db column name
            }
            else if (paramName == "Address")
            {
              return "address"; // this is the db column name
            }
            
            return null;
        }
    }


Beta 1
======

- Fix conversion using TypeConverters. The Converter won't be invoked if 
  the input is null.

- The binder was extracted from MonoRail code base.
