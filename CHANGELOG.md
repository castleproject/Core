# Castle Core Changelog

## 5.2.1 (2025-03-09)

(Note: Version 5.2.0 was skipped due to issues with the automated CI release process.)

Enhancements:
- Two new generic method overloads `proxyGenerator.CreateClassProxy<TClass>([options], constructorArguments, interceptors)` (@backstromjoel, #636)
- Allow specifying which attributes should always be copied to proxy class by adding attribute type to `AttributesToAlwaysReplicate`. Previously only non-inherited, with `Inherited=false`, attributes were copied. (@shoaibshakeel381, #633)
- Support for C# 8+ [default interface methods](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/default-interface-methods) in interface and class proxies without target (@stakx, #661)
- DynamicProxy's public API has been augmented with nullable reference type annotations (@stakx, #668)

Bugfixes:
- `ArgumentException`: "Could not find method overriding method" with overridden class method having generic by-ref parameter (@stakx, #657)
- `ArgumentException`: "Cannot create an instance of `TEnum` because `Type.ContainsGenericParameters` is true" caused by `Enum` constraint on method `out` parameter (@stakx, #658)

## 5.1.1 (2022-12-30)

Bugfixes:
- Proxies using records derived from a base generic record broken using .NET 6 compiler (@CesarD, #632)
- Failure proxying type that has a non-inheritable custom attribute type applied where `null` argument is given for array parameter  (@stakx, #637)
- Nested custom attribute types do not get replicated (@stakx, #638)

## 5.1.0 (2022-08-02)

Enhancements:
- Support for covariant method returns (@stakx, #619)
- Performance improvement with proxy type generation for class proxies (without target). Abstract class methods now reuse a predefined invocation type (like methods of interface proxies without target; see explanation below at version 5.0.0 enhancements) (@stakx, #626)

Bugfixes:
- DynamicProxy emits invalid metadata for redeclared event (@stakx, #590)
- Proxies using records with a base class broken using .NET 6 compiler (@ajcvickers, #601)
- `MissingMethodException` when proxying interfaces containing sealed methods (@stakx, #621)

## 5.0.0 (2022-05-11)

Enhancements:
- .NET 6.0 support (@Jevonius, #616)
- .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1 support (@lg2de, #485)
- Non-intercepted methods on a class proxy with target are now forwarded to the target (@stakx, #571)
- Significant performance improvements with proxy type generation for interface proxies without target. Up until now, DynamicProxy generated a separate `IInvocation` implementation type for every single proxied method &ndash; it is now able to reuse a single predefined type in many cases, thereby reducing the total amount of dynamic type generation. (@stakx, #573)

Bugfixes:
- Generic method with differently named generic arguments to parent throws `KeyNotFoundException` (@stakx, #106)
- Proxying certain `[Serializable]` classes produces proxy types that fail PEVerify test (@stakx, #367)
- `private protected` methods are not intercepted (@CrispyDrone, #535)
- `System.UIntPtr` unsupported (@stakx, #546)
- DynamicProxy generates two modules when proceeding from a class proxy's protected method to the target, causing an `InvalidOperationException` when saving the generated assembly to disk (@stakx, #569)
- Upgrade log4net to v2.0.13 (@jonorossi, @stakx, @dschwartzni, #574, #605)

Deprecations:
- Removed support for the .NET Framework < 4.6.2 and .NET Standard 1.x. (@stakx, #495, #496; @Jevonius, #614)
- Removed support for Code Access Security (CAS). (@stakx, #502)
- Removed support for Remoting. This library no longer defines any types deriving from `MarshalByRefObject`, and `ProxyUtil.IsProxy` (which used to recognize remoting/"transparent" proxies) now tests only for DynamicProxy proxies. (@stakx, #507)
- The following public members have been removed:
  - `Castle.Core.Internal.CollectionExtensions` (class)
  - `Castle.Core.Internal.Lock` (class) along with all related types and methods
  - `Castle.Core.Internal.PermissionUtil.IsGranted` (method)
  - `Castle.Core.Pair<,>` (type). Use `System.ValueTuple<,>` or `System.Tuple<,>` instead.
  - all type members in `Castle.DynamicProxy.ModuleScope` that gave direct access to DynamicProxy's type cache and `ModuleBuilder`s. Only `SaveAssembly`, `LoadAssemblyIntoCache`, and members supporting these two facilities are left public.
  - almost all types and type members in the `Castle.DynamicProxy.*` sub-namespaces, as most of them are intended for internal use only.
  - DynamicProxy's custom exception types have been replaced by standard BCL exceptions (where appropriate), and by a single `DynamicProxyException` type for internal DynamicProxy errors.

## 4.4.1 (2020-05-06)

Bugfixes:
- Prevent method name collisions when a proxy type implements more than two identically named interfaces having one or more identically named methods each. Name collisions are avoided by including the declaring types' namespaces in the proxy type's method names. (@stakx, #469)
- Reduce lock contention while generating new proxy types which previously blocked new proxy instances (@tangdf, #484)
- Fix mixins where proxy constructor fields were ordered differently to interfaces because of different case comparisons (@zapov, #475)
- Fix proxy generation for types having only a `private protected` constructor (@mriehm, #491)

## 4.4.0 (2019-04-05)

Enhancements:
- Added trace logging level below Debug; maps to Trace in log4net/NLog, and Verbose in Serilog (@pi3k14, #404)
- Recognize read-only parameters by the `In` modreq (@zvirja, #406)
- DictionaryAdapter: Exposed GetAdapter overloads with NameValueCollection parameter in .NET Standard (@rzontar, #423)
- Ability to add delegate mixins to proxies using `ProxyGenerationOptions.AddDelegate[Type]Mixin`. You can bind to the mixed-in `Invoke` methods on the proxy using `ProxyUtil.CreateDelegateToMixin`. (@stakx, #436)
- New `IInvocation.CaptureProceedInfo()` method to enable better implementations of asynchronous interceptors (@stakx, #439)

Deprecations:
- The API surrounding `Lock` has been deprecated. This consists of the members listed below. Consider using the Base Class Library's `System.Threading.ReaderWriterLockSlim` instead. (@stakx, #391)
   - `Castle.Core.Internal.Lock` (class)
   - `Castle.Core.Internal.ILockHolder` (interface)
   - `Castle.Core.Internal.IUpgradeableLockHolder` (interface)
- You should no longer manually emit types into DynamicProxy's dynamic assembly. For this reason, the following member has been deprecated. (@stakx, #445)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.ModuleScope.DefineType` (method)
- The proxy type cache in `ModuleScope` should no longer be accessed directly. For this reason, the members listed below have been deprecated. (@stakx, #391)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.ModuleScope.Lock` (property)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.ModuleScope.GetFromCache` (method)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.ModuleScope.RegisterInCache` (method)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.BaseProxyGenerator.AddToCache` (method)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.BaseProxyGenerator.GetFromCache` (method)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.CacheKey` (class)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.Serialization.CacheMappingsAttribute.ApplyTo` (method)
   - `Castle.DynamicProxy.Serialization.CacheMappingsAttribute.GetDeserializedMappings` (method)

## 4.3.1 (2018-06-21)

Enhancements:
 - Use shared read locking to reduce lock contention in InvocationHelper and ProxyUtil (@TimLovellSmith, #377)

Bugfixes:
- Prevent interceptors from being able to modify `in` parameters (@stakx, #370)
- Make default value replication of optional parameters more tolerant of default values that are represented in metadata with a mismatched type (@stakx, #371)
- Fix a concurrency issue (writing without taking a write lock first) in `BaseProxyGenerator.ObtainProxyType` (@stakx, #383)

Deprecations:
- `Castle.DynamicProxy.Generators.Emitters.ArgumentsUtil.IsAnyByRef` (@stakx, #370)

## 4.3.0 (2018-06-07)

Enhancements:
- Added .NET Standard/.NET Core support for NLog (@snakefoot, #200)
- Added .NET Standard/.NET Core support for log4net (@snakefoot, #201)
- DynamicProxy supported C# `in` parameter modifiers only on the .NET Framework up until now. Adding .NET Standard 1.5 as an additional target to the NuGet package makes them work on .NET Core, too (@stakx, #339)
- Replicate custom attributes on constructor parameters in the generated proxy type constructors to fulfill introspection of constructors. This does not change the proxying behavior. (@stakx, #341)
- Improve performance of InvocationHelper cache lookups (@tangdf, #358)
- Improve fidelity of default value replication of optional parameters to fulfill inspection of the generated proxies. This does not change the proxying behavior. (@stakx, #356)

Bugfixes:
- Fix Castle.Services.Logging.Log4netIntegration assembly file name casing which breaks on Linux (@beginor, #324)

- Fix TraceLoggerFactory to allow specifying the default logger level (@acjh, #342)
- Ensure that DynamicProxy doesn't create invalid dynamic assemblies when proxying types from non-strong-named assemblies (@stakx, #327)
- Fix interceptor selectors being passed `System.RuntimeType` for class proxies instead of the target type (@stakx, #359)
- Replace NullReferenceException with descriptive one thrown when interceptors swallow exceptions and cause a null value type to be returned (@jonorossi, #85)

## 4.2.1 (2017-10-11)

Bugfixes:
- Add missing equality checks in `MethodSignatureComparer.EqualSignatureTypes` to fix `TypeLoadException`s ("Method does not have an implementation") (@stakx, #310)

## 3.0.0 beta 1 (2011-08-14)

Breaking Changes:
* Removed overloads of logging methods that were taking format string from ILogger and ILogger and IExtendedLogger and didn't have word Format in their name.
  * For example:
    * void Error(string format, params object[] args); // was removed
    * void ErrorFormat(string format, params object[] args); //use this one instead
  * impact - low
  * fixability - medium
  * description - To minimize confusion and duplication those methods were removed.
  * fix - Use methods that have explicit "Format" word in their name and same signature.
* Removed WebLogger and WebLoggerFactory
  * impact - low
  * fixability - medium
  * description - To minimize management overhead the classes were removed so that only single Client Profile version of Castle.Core can be distributed.
  * fix - You can use NLog or Log4Net web logger integration, or reuse implementation of existing web logger and use it as a custom logger.
* Removed obsolete overload of ProxyGenerator.CreateClassProxy
  * impact - low
  * fixability - trivial
  * description - Deprecated overload of ProxyGenerator.CreateClassProxy was removed to keep the method consistent with other methods and to remove confusion
  * fix - whenever removed overload was used, use one of the other overloads.
* IProxyGenerationHook.NonVirtualMemberNotification method was renamed
  * impact - high
  * fixability - easy
  * description - to accommodate class proxies with target method NonVirtualMemberNotification on IProxyGenerationHook type was renamed to more accurate
    NonProxyableMemberNotification 	since for class proxies with target not just methods but also fields and other member that break the abstraction will
    be passed to this method.
  * fix - whenever NonVirtualMemberNotification is used/implemented change the method name to
	  NonProxyableMemberNotification. Implementors should also accommodate possibility that not
	  only MethodInfos will be passed as method's second parameter.
* DynamicProxy will now allow to intercept members of System.Object
  * impact - very low
  * fixability - easy
  * description - to allow scenarios like mocking of System.Object members, DynamicProxy will not
	  disallow proxying of these methods anymore. AllMethodsHook (default IProxyGenerationHook)
	  will still filter them out though.
  * fix - whenever custom IProxyGenerationHook is used, user should account for System.Object's
	  members being now passed to ShouldInterceptMethod and NonVirtualMemberNotification methods
	  and if necessary update the code to handle them appropriately.

  "I chose to preserve backwards compatibility by implementing the code in the 
  reverse order as suggested by the reporter. Given the following URI for a resource:

  assembly://my.cool.assembly/context/moo/file.xml

  It will initially look for an embedded resource with the manifest name of 
  "my.cool.assembly.context.moo.file.xml" in the loaded assembly my.cool.assembly.dll. 
  If it does not find it, then it looks for the embedded resource with the manifest name
