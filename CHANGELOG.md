## 3.0.0 beta 1 (2011-08-14)

Breaking Changes:
* Removed overloads of logging methods that were taking format string from ILogger and ILogger and IExtendedLogger and didn't have word Format in their name.
  * For example:
    * void Error(string format, params object[] args); // was removed
    * void ErrorFormat(string format, params object[] args); //use this one instead
  * impact - low
  * fixability - medium
  * description - To minimize confusion and duplication those methods were removed.
  * fix - Use methods that have explicit "Format" word in their name and same signature.
* Removed WebLogger and WebLoggerFactory
  * impact - low
  * fixability - medium
  * description - To minimize management overhead the classes were removed so that only single Client Profile version of Castle.Core can be distributed.
  * fix - You can use NLog or Log4Net web logger integration, or reuse implementation of existing web logger and use it as a custom logger.
* Removed obsolete overload of ProxyGenerator.CreateClassProxy
  * impact - low
  * fixability - trivial
  * description - Deprecated overload of ProxyGenerator.CreateClassProxy was removed to keep the method consistent with other methods and to remove confusion
  * fix - whenever removed overload was used, use one of the other overloads.
* IProxyGenerationHook.NonVirtualMemberNotification method was renamed
  * impact - high
  * fixability - easy
  * description - to accommodate class proxies with target method NonVirtualMemberNotification on IProxyGenerationHook type was renamed to more accurate
    NonProxyableMemberNotification 	since for class proxies with target not just methods but also fields and other member that break the abstraction will
    be passed to this method.
  * fix - whenever NonVirtualMemberNotification is used/implemented change the method name to
	  NonProxyableMemberNotification. Implementors should also accommodate possibility that not
	  only MethodInfos will be passed as method's second parameter.
* DynamicProxy will now allow to intercept members of System.Object
  * impact - very low
  * fixability - easy
  * description - to allow scenarios like mocking of System.Object members, DynamicProxy will not
	  disallow proxying of these methods anymore. AllMethodsHook (default IProxyGenerationHook)
	  will still filter them out though.
  * fix - whenever custom IProxyGenerationHook is used, user should account for System.Object's
	  members being now passed to ShouldInterceptMethod and NonVirtualMemberNotification methods
	  and if neccessary update the code to handle them appropriately.

  "assembly resource format only works for resources where the assemblies name and default namespace are the same."
  
  Quoting:

  "I chose to preserve backwards compatibility by implementing the code in the 
  reverse order as suggested by the reporter. Given the following URI for a resource:

  assembly://my.cool.assembly/context/moo/file.xml

  It will initially look for an embedded resource with the manifest name of 
  "my.cool.assembly.context.moo.file.xml" in the loaded assembly my.cool.assembly.dll. 
  If it does not find it, then it looks for the embedded resource with the manifest name 
  of "context.moo.file.xml".

  a standard way to have access to common services, for example, logger factories
- Added missing log factories
- Refactor StreamLogger and DiagnosticLogger to be more consistent behavior-wise
- Refactored WebLogger to extend LevelFilteredLogger (removed duplication)
- Refactored LoggerLevel order
