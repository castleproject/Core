Hi,

I'd like to announce the alpha release of a Markdown library for [Ruby][1]
called "BlueCloth". It's mostly a direct port of the most recent Perl version,
minus the various plugin hooks and whatnot.

More information can be found on [the project page][2], or feel free to ask me
directly. I don't have much in the way of a demo yet, but will be working on
getting something set up in the coming days.
