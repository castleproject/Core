- A Textile Reference:
  - Textile is a simple text markup.  Simple symbols mark words' emphasis.  Blocks of text
    can be easily tagged as headers, quotes, or lists.  A Textile document can then be
    converted to HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) for viewing on the web.
  - You can try Textile out on the "Textile home page":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/.
    Textile is also available as "RedCloth":http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/ for
    Ruby or "PyTextile":http://dealmeida.net/projects/textile for Python.
  - Also refer to the "*Quick Reference*":javascript:quickRedReference(); for this guide.
  - h4. Reading the Examples
  - In each section below, examples are provided to clearly illustrate.  In each example,
    the Textile example is followed by the raw HTML it is translated into, followed by how
    the HTML appears in the browser.
  - 
    - Textile example
    - Converted to HTML
    - Browser-view
- Writing in Textile:
  - Textile looks for paragraphs in your text.  Paragraphs are separated by one blank line.
    Every paragraph is translated as an HTML paragraph.
  - !!example "A single paragraph.\n\nFollowed by another."
  - h4. Using HTML in Textile
  - You can certainly use HTML tags inside your Textile documents.  HTML will only be escaped
    if it's found in a @pre@ or @code@ block.
  - !!example "I am <b>very</b> serious.\n\n<pre>\n  I am <b>very</b> serious.\n</pre>"
  - h4. Line Breaks
  - Line breaks are converted to HTML breaks.
  - !!example "I spoke.\nAnd none replied."
  - Line breaks can be disabled in RedCloth by turning on @fold_lines@.
  - h4. Entities
  - Single- and double-quotes around words or phrases are converted to curly quotations, much easier on the eye.
  - !!example '"Observe!"'
  - Double hyphens are replaced with an em-dash.
  - !!example Observe -- very nice!
  - Single hyphens are replaced with en-dashes.
  - !!example Observe - tiny and brief.
  - Triplets of periods become an ellipsis.
  - !!example Observe...
  - The letter 'x' becomes a dimension sign when used alone.
  - !!example 'Observe: 2 x 2.'
  - Conversion of trademark and copyright symbols.
  - !!example 'one(TM), two(R), three(C).'
- Quick Block Modifiers:
  - Blocks of text default to being treated as paragraphs.  But modifers can be affixed
    to the beginning of a block to change its treatment.
  - h4. Headers
  - To make an entire paragraph into a Header, place "h<em>n</em>." at 
    its beginning, where _n_ is a number from 1-6.
  - !!example h1. Header 1
  - !!example h2. Header 2
  - !!example h3. Header 3
  - h4. Block Quotes
  - To make an entire paragraph into a block quotation, place
    "bq." before it.
  - !!example "An old text\n\nbq. A block quotation.\n\nAny old text"
  - h4. Footnotes
  - Numeric references within text to footnotes appear between square brackets.
  - !!example This is covered elsewhere[1].
  - To create the footnote that corresponds to its reference within the text, begin a new paragraph with fn and the 
    footnote's number, followed by a dot and a space.
  - !!example fn1. Down here, in fact.
- Quick Phrase Modifiers:
  - h4. Structural Emphasis
  - Emphasis to text is added by surrounding a phrase with underscores.  In HTML, this often
    appears as <em>italics</em>.
  - !!example I _believe_ every word.
  - Strength can be give to text by surrounding with asterisks.  In HTML, this strength appears
    as <strong>bold</strong>.
  - !!example And then? She *fell*!
  - Both italics and bold can be forced by doubling the underscores or asterisks.
  - !!example "I __know__.\nI **really** __know__."
  - Use double question marks to indicate _citation_.  The title of a book, for instance.
  - !!example "??Cat's Cradle?? by Vonnegut"
  - Code phrases can be surrounded by at-symbols.
  - !!example "Convert with @r.to_html@"
  - To indicate a passage which has been deleted, surround the passage with hypens.
  - !!example "I'm -sure- not sure."
  - Pluses around a passage indicate its insertion.
  - !!example "You are a +pleasant+ child."
  - To superscript a phrase, surround with carets.
  - !!example "a ^2^ + b ^2^ = c ^2^"
  - To subscript, surround with tildes.
  - !!example "log ~2~ x"
  - h4. HTML-Specific
  - Lastly, if you find yourself needing to customize the style of a passage, use percent symbols
    to translate the passage as an HTML span.
  - !!example I'm %unaware% of most soft drinks.
  - This way, you can apply style settings, as described in the next section to arbitrary phrases.
  - !!example "I'm %{color:red}unaware%\nof most soft drinks."
- Attributes:
  - Tailoring Textile to suit your needs is quite easy.  Attributes allow you to provide CSS(Cascading
    Style Sheets) information about any phrase.
  - h4. Block Attributes
  - A block can be tagged with a CSS class by circling the class in parentheses and
    placing it just before the period which marks the block.
  - !!example p(example1). An example
  - An element ID can be given by prefixing the ID with a pound symbol and using it in place of
    the class.
  - !!example p(#big-red). Red here
  - Class and ID can be combined by placing the class first.
  - !!example p(example1#big-red2). Red here
  - Style settings can be provided directly by surrounding them in curly braces.
  - !!example p{color:blue;margin:30px}. Spacey blue
  - Language designations can be given between angel brackets.
  - !!example p[fr]. rouge
  - h4. Phrase Attributes
  - All block attributes can be applied to phrases as well by placing them just inside the
    opening modifier.
  - !!example "I seriously *{color:red}blushed*\nwhen I _(big)sprouted_ that\ncorn stalk from my\n%[es]cabeza%."
  - h4. Block Alignments
  - Text inside blocks can be aligned in four basic ways.
  - !!example p<. align left
  - !!example p>. align right
  - !!example p=. centered
  - !!example p<>. justified
  - Indentation can also be specified by provide a single left paren for every 1em to the left.  A single right
    paren for every 1em to the right.
  - !!example p(. left ident 1em
  - !!example p((. left ident 2em
  - !!example p))). right ident 3em
  - h4. Combining Alignments
  - Identation may be coupled with alignment.
  - !!example "h2()>. Bingo."
  - And, furthermore, coupled with language settings and CSS styles.
  - !!example "h3()>[no]{color:red}. Bingo"
  - h4. HTML in Textile
  - Textile is designed for quickening the simple markups.  For more complex formatting, you are encouraged
    to break out into HTML.
  - For example, long code blocks belong between @pre@ and @code@ tags.  Please also indent your code inside
    the tags to be sure that all Textile processors out there will ignore the contents.
  - !!example |
      <pre>
      <code>
        a.gsub!( /</, '' )
      </code>
      </pre>
  - You may also choose to surround sections with @div@ tags to separate your document into sections.
    "Instiki":http://www.instiki.org/ uses this technique to float a sidebar to the right.
  - !!example |
      <div style="float:right;">
      
      h3. Sidebar

      "Hobix":http://hobix.com/
      "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org/

      </div>
      
      The main text of the
      page goes here and will 
      stay to the left of the 
      sidebar.

- Lists:
  - h4. Numeric Lists
  - To make a numbered list, place each item in its own paragraph, preceded by "#".
  - !!example "# A first item\n# A second item\n# A third"
  - These lists may be nested by increasing the number of pound symbols preceding child entries.
  - !!example "# Fuel could be:\n## Coal\n## Gasoline\n## Electricity\n# Humans need only:\n## Water\n## Protein"
  - h4. Bulleted Lists
  - Bulleted lists use an asterisk in place of the pound.
  - !!example "* A first item\n* A second item\n* A third"
  - These lists may be nested in like manner.
  - !!example "* Fuel could be:\n** Coal\n** Gasoline\n** Electricity\n* Humans need only:\n** Water\n** Protein"
- External References:
  - h4. Hypertext Links
  - Basic links are comprised of a phrase which is linked to a URL(Universal Resource Locator).  Place the
    descriptive phrase in quotation marks.  Follow it immediately by a colon and the URL.
  - !!example I searched "Google":http://google.com.
  - Notice, the link won't include any trailing punctuation.
  - h4. Link Aliases
  - If you are using the same link several times in your document, or you'd just like to be a tad more
    organized, you can use a link alias.  Place the URL anywhere in your document, beginning with its
    alias in square brackets.  Then, use the alias in place of the URL, using the link format above.
  - !!example |
      I am crazy about "Hobix":hobix
      and "it's":hobix "all":hobix I ever
      "link to":hobix!

      [hobix]http://hobix.com
  - h4. Embedded Images
  - You can embed an image in your Textile document by surrounding its URL with exclamation marks.
  - !!example "!http://hobix.com/sample.jpg!" 
  - URLs may be relative.
  - A title for the image can also be provided in parens, just before the closing exclamation.
  - !!example "!openwindow1.gif(Bunny.)!"
  - The title also acts as *alt* text should the image not be found.
  - Links can be attached to images with a colon.
  - !!example "!openwindow1.gif!:http://hobix.com/"
  - h4. Image Alignments
  - Alignments can be applied as well to images.
  - !!example "!>obake.gif!\n\nAnd others sat all round the small\nmachine and paid it to sing to them."
  - h4. Acronyms
  - Definitions for acronyms can be provided by following an acronym with its definition in parens.
  - !!example We use CSS(Cascading Style Sheets).
- Tables:
  - Simple tables can be built by separating fields with pipe characters
  - !!example "| name | age | sex |\n| joan | 24 | f |\n| archie | 29 | m |\n| bella | 45 | f |"
  - Specify header cells by marking them with an underscore and period.
  - !!example "|_. name |_. age |_. sex |\n| joan | 24 | f |\n| archie | 29 | m |\n| bella | 45 | f |"
  - h4. Cell Attributes
  - The period used above marks the end of a cell's attributes.  Other attributes can be applied as well.
  - !!example "|_. attribute list |\n|<. align left |\n|>. align right|\n|=. center |\n|<>. justify |\n|^. valign top |\n|~. bottom |"
  - You can also specify colspans with a backslash, followed by the cell width.
  - !!example "|\\2. spans two cols |\n| col 1 | col 2 |"
  - Rowspan is specified by a forward slash, followed by the row height.
  - !!example "|/3. spans 3 rows | a |\n| b |\n| c |"
  - All block attributes can be applied to table cells as well.
  - !!example "|{background:#ddd}. Grey cell|"
  - h4. Table and Row Attributes
  - Table-wide attributes can be applied before the first row of the table.  On its own line, followed by
    a period.
  - !!example "table{border:1px solid black}.\n|This|is|a|row|\n|This|is|a|row|"
  - Attributes can be applied to a single row by supplying the attribute before the row starts, using a
    @table@ modifier and following it by a period.
  - !!example "|This|is|a|row|\n{background:#ddd}. |This|is|grey|row|"
