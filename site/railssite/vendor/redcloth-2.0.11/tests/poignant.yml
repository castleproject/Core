  _The cat Trady Blix.  Frozen in emptiness.  Immaculate whiskers rigid.  Placid
  eyes of lake.  Tail of warm icicle.  Sponsored by a Very Powerful Pause Button._


  The darkness surrounding Blix can be called *negative space*.  Hang on to that phrase.
  Let it suggest that the emptiness has a negative connotation.  In a similar way,
  @nil@ has a slightly sour note that it whistles.


  Generally speaking, everything in Ruby has a positive charge to it.  This spark
  flows through strings, numbers, regexps, all of it.  Only two keywords wear a
  shady cloak: @nil@ and @false@ draggin us down.


  You can test that charge with an @if@ keyword.  It looks very much like the
  @do@ blocks we saw in the last chapter, in that both end with an @end@.


  <pre>
    if plastic_cup
      print "Plastic cup is on the up 'n' up!"
    end
  </pre>


  If @plastic_cup@ contains either @nil@ or @false@, you won't see anything print
  to the screen.  They're not on the @if@ guest list.  So @if@ isn't going to run
  any of the code it's protecting.


  But @nil@ and @false@ need not walk away in shame.  They may be of questionable
  character, but @unless@ runs a smaller establishment that caters to the bedraggled.
  The @unless@ keyword has a policy of only allowing those with a negative charge in.
  Who are: @nil@ and @false@.
  

  <pre>
    unless plastic_cup
      print "Plastic cup is on the down low."
    end
  </pre>


  You can also use @if@ and @unless@ at the end of a single line of code, if that's
  all that is being protected.


  <pre>
    print "Yeah, plastic cup is up again!" if plastic_cup
    print "Hardly. It's down." unless plastic_cup
  </pre>


  Now that you've met @false@, I'm sure you can see what's on next.
