			Debug.Assert(target == null, $"{nameof(InterfaceMethodWithoutTargetInvocation)} does not support targets.");
			Debug.Assert(proxiedMethod.IsAbstract, $"{nameof(InterfaceMethodWithoutTargetInvocation)} does not support non-abstract methods.");

			// Why this restriction? Because it greatly benefits proxy type generation performance.
			//
			// For invocations that can proceed to a target, `InvokeMethodOnTarget`'s implementation
			// depends on the target method's signature. Because of this, DynamicProxy needs to
			// dynamically generate a separate invocation type per such method. Type generation is
			// always expensive... that is, slow.
			//
			// However, if it is known that `InvokeMethodOnTarget` won't forward, but throw,
			// no custom (dynamically generated) invocation type is needed at all, and we can use
			// this unspecific invocation type instead.
		}

		// The next three properties mimick the behavior seen with an interface proxy without target.
		// (This is why this type's name starts with `Interface`.) A similar type could be written
		// for class proxies without target, but the values returned here would be different.
