Change history
--------------

Release Candidate 1
===================

- Added watir tests for JS proxies (fixes MR-142 "Write test cases for AjaxHelper.GenerateJSProxy()")

- Added watir tests for Ajax support

- Changed Ajax helper to default to parameters:'value=' + value instead of parameters:value.
  This old way was causing null keys on the form dictionary and thus being ignored by 
  the databinder

- Fixed MR-106
  "Apply Sean's suggestions"
  
  Component 'ChildContentComponent' introduced, plus a few test cases for it.

- Fixed MR-101
  "Seems Wizard Controller can't define Area"

- Fixed MR-128
  "Introduce the notion of conditions to WizardStepPage"
  
  Introduced IsPreConditionSatisfied to WizardStepPage

- Fixed MR-129
  "Add log support as discussed on the mailing list"

- Added Logger property to Controller

- Added more logging information to the request lifecycle

- Logging support: Important services are now logging what they are doing. 
  Verbose logging happens at Debug Level. Error level is used for exceptions

- Refactored: The EngineContextModule was simplified. Now its duty is to 
  instantiate the services and invoke the lifecycle methods. Each service uses
  its lifecycle methods to reference other services and obtain its configuration

- Refactored: replaceable services were moved to Services namespace

- Refactored: interfaces meant to be public were moved from Internal 
  namespace to the root

- Fixed MR-126
  "PaginationHelper must support IList<T>"

- Fixed MR-146
  "FormHelper must be able to handle IList<T>"

- Fixed MR-145 
  "Change node/section name from monoRail to monorail on configuration file"
  
  Now on the configuration, use <monorail> instead of <monoRail>

- Included Test site for ActiveRecord support project, watir tests included

- Refactored ARDataBinder to support HasMany and HasAndBelongsToMany

- Applied Ernst Naezer <enix@ch10.shuis.tudelft.nl>'s patch fixing build

- Introduced [AjaxAction] attribute. Any action marked with this attribute
  can be accessed on client-side scripting using a JavaScript proxy, like
  this:

     $ajaxHelper.getJavascriptFunctions()
       ## MANDATORY, must come before any call to generateJSProxy

     $ajaxHelper.generateJSProxy('thisController')
       ## will declare an object named "thisController", allowing access
       ## to all [AjaxAction]s on the current controller

     $ajaxHelper.generateJSProxy('util', 'lists', 'myLists')
       ## will declare an object named "myLists", allowing access
       ## to all [AjaxAction]s on the controller named 'lists', in the 'util' area

  Note that proxies can perform synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking) calls.
  For asynchronous calls, you must always supply a JavaScript function as an additional
  last parameter. When that parameter is absent, the proxy will perform a synchronous call.

     [AjaxAction] public void Sum(int num1, int num2) { RenderText(Convert.ToString(num1 + num2)); }

  You can write:

     // synchronous call
     $('result').value = myLists.sum($('num1').value, $('num2').value);

  Or:

     // asynchronous call
     myLists.sum($('num1').value, $('num2').value, function(t) { $('result').value = t.responseText; });

  Being:

     $('num1').value     = the value of an input with id=num1
     $('num2').value     = the value of an input with id=num2
     function(t) { ... } = the callback
     t.responseText      = any text that the action could have rendered

- Applied Marc-André's patch fixing MR-140
  "ARDataBindAttribute doesn't  use the controller's DataBinder"

- Updated AbstractServiceContainer to support adding/removing services.

- MonoRails services now accept and IServiceContainer instead of an
  IServiceProvider to be able to add services if desired.

- Small refactor of Controller to to accomodate passing action arguments.

- Updated SmartDispatchController to utilize HttpRequest parameters when
  additional arguments are supplied via a Send.

- Applied patch by Freyr Magnússon <freyr.magnusson@gmail.com> fixing MR-139
  "ExceptionChainingExtension doesn´t handle unhandled exceptions"
  
  Which also introduces a new feature:

Controllers can request IExceptionProcessor through IServiceProvider
and invoke the handlers to process an exception. For example:

public void BuyMercedes()
{
		try
		{
			...
		}
		catch(Exception ex)
		{
			IExceptionProcessor exProcessor = (IExceptionProcessor) ServiceProvider.GetService(typeof(IExceptionProcessor));
			exProcessor.ProcessException(ex);

			RenderView("CouldNotBuyMercedes");
		}
}

- Changed DataBinder behavior to return empty arrays, instead of null arrays, 
  when the IBindingDataSourceNode is null

- Applied patch by  Bryan Brown fixing MR-138
  "patch to fix formhelper.LabelFor to use IDictionary"

- Applied Freyr Magnússon's patch fixing MR-137
  "Databinding through DataBindAttribute does not register errors with SmartDispatcherController"

- Applied peter dol's patch fixing MR-136
  "An overload for ButtonToRemote that accepts htmloptions"

- WizardStepPage: added more redirect overloads to allow parameters to be 
  specified

- AR Support: Added support to deal with ICollection<T> containers

- Applied Marc-Andre's patch fixing MR-133
  "TestSupport not working under Mono"

- Removed PropertyBag.Clear() in Controller.cs to restore the ability to
  update the PropertyBag in filters.

- Applied Colin Ramsay <castleproject-devel@happyandlost.co.uk> patch making
  the _selectedViewName field accessible through a public property.

- Checked in changes to better support ASP.NET Views

- Refactor FormHelper to use a common code to CheckboxList and Select. 
  Added support mentioned in MR-130

- Introduced CreateCheckboxList. See preliminary documentation at 
    http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/MonoRail:FormHelper#CheckboxList

- Applied Colin Ramsay <castleproject-devel@happyandlost.co.uk> patch adding more
  asserts to TestSupport.AbstractMRTestCase and refactored some other things

- MR-125 testsupport doesn't handle posting to smart dispatcher controller 
  Fixed by Andrei Shires <andrei@internetware.co.uk>

- FormHelper: Now it can fill parameters with the values from the Request.Params

- FormHelper: fixed Checkbox behavior with databinder by adding a hidden 
  field with the same name but carrying the 'false' value. The false value
  can be overriden with a key 'falseValue' if you're working with a non-boolean
  
  For example
  
  FormHelper.CheckboxField("some.property")
  
  Will render
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="some_property" name="some.property" value="true" />
  <input type="hidden" id="some_propertyH" name="some.property" value="false" />


  FormHelper.CheckboxField("acceptDisclaimer", %{trueValue = 'accept', hiddenValue = 'reject'})
  
  Will render
  
  <input type="checkbox" id="acceptDisclaimer" name="acceptDisclaimer" value="accept" />
  <input type="hidden" id="acceptDisclaimerH" name="acceptDisclaimer" value="reject" />


- Applied Ernst Naezer's patch to allow MR to throw a descriptive
  exception message when two helpers are registered using the same key

- Added a hack to the WebFormsViewEngine to accomodate different behavior
  with respect to invoking PageParser.GetCompiledInstance on ASP.NET 2.0

- Added support for defaultValue attribute to FormHelper, which specificy
  what the value should be if the target evaluates to null.

- Added indexed properties support to FormHelper

  When the target is an array you can
  
    PropertyBag.Add("roles", Roles.FindAll());
    --
    FormHelper.TextField("roles[0].Id")
  
  Which will output
  
    <input type="text" id="roles_0_Id" name="roles[0].Id" value="1" />

  The indexed property can be nested

    PropertyBag.Add("user", User.Find(1));
    --
    FormHelper.TextField("user.roles[0].Id")

    <input type="text" id="user_roles_0_Id" name="user.roles[0].Id" value="1" />

- Added RadioField(String target, object valueToSend, [IDictionary attributes]) to FormHelper

  The radio will be marked with checked="checked" if the value collected 
  from the target matches the valueToSend parameter

- Fixed RedirectToAction on WizardStepPage. Now it produces a correct action url.

- Changed WizardStepPage.InternalRedirectToStep to simply RedirectToStep

- Changed SmartDispatcherController.BuildMethodArguments. Now it tests if the conversion 
  succeeded before setting the value on the array.

- Introduced IWizardPageFactory on WindsorExtension, so a Wizard controller doesn't
  need to reference the IKernel directly

- Some optimization on Redirect* methods on Controller class. Now they accept
  an IDictionary as a parameter specifier (in addition to NameValueCollection).
  
- Refactored ControllerDescriptorBuilder (renamed to ControllerDescriptorProvider)
  to use child providers to obtain descriptor. Attributes are now descriptors builders
  and that allows one to come up with custom attributes like

  public class MyAttribute : Attribute, ILayoutDescriptorBuilder, IHelperDescriptorBuilder
  {
     public LayoutDescriptor BuildLayoutDescriptor() 
     {
       return new LayoutDescriptor("mylayout");
     }

     public HelperDescriptor[] BuildHelperDescriptors()
     {
       return new HelperDescriptor[] { new HelperDescriptor(typeof(MyHelper)) };
     }
  }

  Kudos to Fabio by coming up with the idea.

- ViewComponents: added subsection support

  (Using nvelocity as example)
  
  #blockcomponent(GridComponent)
    #header
      <th>Name</th>
    #end
    
    #footer
      Showing record $startrecord to $total
    #end
    
    #item
      <td>$item.Name</td>
    #end

    #empty
      <td>No records found</td>
    #end
  #end
  
  On the code you can use

	public override bool SupportsSection(String name)
	{
		return name == "header" || name == "item" || name == "footer" || 
			name == "empty";
	}

	public override void Render()
	{
		ICollection source = (ICollection) ComponentParams["source"];

		StartTable();

		Context.RenderSection("header");

		if (source != null && source.Count != 0)
		{
			foreach(object item in source)
			{
				PropertyBag["item"] = item;
				
				RenderText("<tr>");
				
				Context.RenderSection("item");
				
				RenderText("</tr>");
			}
		}
		else
		{
			RenderText("<tr>");
			Context.RenderSection("empty");
			RenderText("</tr>");
		}

		Context.RenderSection("footer");

		EndTable();
	}

- ViewComponent on NVelocity: added to support to interpolation on component parameters. 

  Action:
  
    public void List()
    {
      PropertyBag.Add("customers", Customer.FindAll());
    }

  View:

    #blockcomponent(GridComponent with "source=$customers")
  
    #end
  
  ViewComponent code:
  
    public override void Render()
    {
      IList items = (IList) ComponentParams["source"];
    
      foreach(object item in items)
      {
        Context.ContextVars["item"] = item;
        // Do something like rendering the body
      }
    }

- Configuration changed:

  . Added <cacheprovider> node
  . Added <additionalSources> node under <viewEngine>

  Example:
  
  <monoRail>
    <cacheProvider type="my custom implementation"/>
    
    <viewEngine viewPathRoot="views" customEngine="Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity.NVelocityViewEngine, Castle.MonoRail.Framework.Views.NVelocity">
      <additionalSources>
        <assembly name="MyAssembly" namespace="My.Assembly" />
      </additionalSources>
    </viewEngine>
  </monoRail>

- IViewEngine refactored to use the IViewSourceLoader to locate views

- Introduced IViewSourceLoader and IViewSource. The former represents an approach to load
  views. The default implementation is FileAssemblyViewSourceLoader which first look ups 
  the file system then the configured assemblies for the specified view

- ICacheProvider service introduced (available on IServiceProvider implementation).
  Two implementations available: 
  
  . DefaultCacheProvider which uses the HttpContext.Cache
  . WeakReferenceCacheProvider which uses a hashtable with WeakReferences as entries

- Warning about Nullables and SmartDispatcher arguments. The behavior has changed a
  little
  
  . In the past, if the value for a nullable was not present, that was accepted and
    the nullable was initialized with HasData=false
  . Now the value mustn't be present, but the entry must be present
  
  For example
  
  Controller Action:
  
	public void Transfer(NullableDouble amount)
	{
		...
	}
  
  If you invoke it with Controller/Transfer.rails you'll get an exception
  
  If you invoke it with Controller/Transfer.rails?amount= then it's ok

  If you invoke it with Controller/Transfer.rails?amount=10 is obviously ok too.

- Removed Obsolete members of ExecuteEnum. If you were using

  . ExecuteEnum.Before, change to ExecuteEnum.BeforeAction
  . ExecuteEnum.After, change to ExecuteEnum.AfterAction or ExecuteEnum.AfterRendering
  . ExecuteEnum.Around, change to ExecuteEnum.Always or combine the flags

- Refactored DefaultRailsEngineContext and EngineContextModule. Now EngineContextModule
  is also a ServiceContainer. When a DefaultRailsEngineContext is created we pass
  the EngineContextModule as a parent container. 
  
  This saves us some cycles of registering
  the services on every single DefaultRailsEngineContext instance.

- Added attribute 'checkClientIsConnected' to monoRail configuration check. If 
  'true' the controller class will always check IsClientConnected on
  
  - InternalSend (beginning)
  - Before Staring filter process 
  - Before invoking the view engine
  
  The default value is 'false'
  
  (kudos to Ahmed)

- Removed AutoLoadUnlessKeyIs and NullIfKeyIs from ARDataBinder. Added enum 
  AutoLoadBehavior to replace them:

  AutoLoadBehavior.Never (default): Means that no autoload should be perform on the target
    type nor on nested types.
      
  AutoLoadBehavior.Always: Means that autoload should be used for the target type
    and the nested types (if present). This demands that the primary key be present on the http request
  
  AutoLoadBehavior.NewInstanceIfInvalidKey: Means that we should autoload, but if the key is 
    invalid, like null, 0 or an empty string, then just create a new instance of the target type.
  
  AutoLoadBehavior.NullIfInvalidKey: Means that we should autoload, but if the key is 
    invalid, like null, 0 or an empty string, then just return null

- Added support for AccessibleThrough(Verb.Post, or Verb.Get) to restrict the type of access a controller action requires.

- Added suport for InPlaceRenderView for Brail

- Added <? ?> tags for Brail, to match the php style.

- Added RemoveCookie() method to IResponse

- Fixed a bug in Brail's ViewComponents, where a parameter was search using case sensitive search.

- Fixed a bug in ARFetch, where if the parameter was an array and the parameters didn't appear, a null reference would be thrown. Now it's returning an empty array.

- Updated boo binaries, should fix the problems with the build on machines with only one framework installed.

- Fixed a bug in Brail where a new line was required before a method call was recognized

- Added support for optional parameters in Brail, using the syntax ?foo will return null if the value was not set (instead of throwing.)

- Fixed a bug where Brail would throw on Empty Views.

- Added support for AutoLoadUnlessKeyIs in ARDataBinder - will load the object unless the key is a specific value
 Usages: public void Save([ARDataBinder(AutoLoadUnlessKeyIs=0)] User user) 

- Added checks for null id when doing data binding.

- Removed useless error handling from Brail, now you'll get the normal ASP.Net Yellow Screen Of Death on errors. More consistent with the rest of the framework.

- Added support for <?brail ?> tags for Brail, so it can be valid XML documents

- Added logging for Brail, so you can see the Boo code the preprocessor is generating.

- Added more verbose output to compiler errors in Brail.

- Changed the way Brail name the generated class, now the chances for name clashes are much lower. (View: Users.boo and a parameter Users will not cause problems).

- Fixed a bug with Brail not picking up changes that occured by VS.Net

- Fixed bug with NVelocity components that caused an InvalidCastException to be thrown by the Render method if there was something other than an IRailsEngineContext occupying the "context" key.

- MonoRail is now CLSCompliant (kudos to Roelof Blom <roelof.blom@gmail.com>)

- Breaking change: now MonoRail requires that you add the following module to web.config:

	<system.web>
		<httpModules>
			<add name="monorail" type="Castle.MonoRail.Framework.EngineContextModule, Castle.MonoRail.Framework" />
		</httpModules>
	</system.web>

- Configuration nodes and attributes changes:
  - mailto to mailTo 
  - mailfrom to mailFrom
  - customsession to customSession

- SmartViewComponent removed

- DataBinder refactored out. Now implementation lies on Castle.Components.Binder
  + Big performance improvement

- ARDataBinder now issues a FindByPK for nested objects if the keys differs (existing object with 
  form fields)

- SmartDispatcherController: now there's no hardcode reference to DataBind, ARDataBind or ARFetch attributes. 
  They only must implement the interface IParameterBinding. This opens an interesting extension point
  for users willing to create their own logic to binding form/querystring parameters to their data components

- Controller: Added RedirectToAction(String action, params String[] queryStringParameters)
  example:  RedirectToAction("edit", "id=" + id, "error=couldn't update the row");

- Added FlashBinderAttribute (being evaluated)

- Added FormHelper (being evaluated)

- Added CaptureFor component

- Renamed ARPager splitted into ARPaginationHelper and ARPager

- ARDataBinder is now able to deal with HasAndBelongsToMany relations. 
  This works in two ways. Suppose you have a Product class with a relation HasAndBelongsToMany to Category.
  
  If you send the following fields from a form:
    
    product.categories.id=1 
    product.categories.id=2
    
  ARDataBinder will ignore the AutoLoad property and always populate the Categories 
  collection on the product class with the result of FindByPrimaryKey of the categories.
  Any other field will be ignored, for example product.categories.name will not be bound
  
  However, if you send the values like
  
    product.categories[0].id=1 
    product.categories[1].id=2
    
  Then ARDataBinder will use the usual path, not ignoring the AutoLoad.
  
  This behavior is being evaluated.

- Removed AbstractExtension

- Extension now uses events (See ExtensionManager)

- Interface IMonoRailExtension changed (has only Init method now)

- Refactored IParameterBinder in order to make it participate on calculations points.

- Introduced WindsorMonoRailSectionHandler which has the support for statements similar to those supported
  by windsor's XmlInterpreter
  
- Added ARDataBindAttribute.NullWhenPrimaryKey which forces the databinder to
  ignore and do not load a record if the retrieved PK has the value assigned to this
  property (kudos to Roelof Blom <roelof.blom@gmail.com>)

Beta 5
======

** Core ** 

- Fixed Flash (it now persists the new entries between requests)  (by Ahmed)

- Added FilterAttribute.ExecutionOrder, the default value is Int32.MaxValue 
  so the less the value higher will be the filter priority

- Added Controller.RedirectToAction(String actionName)

- Added Controller.RedirectToAction overloads (by Fabio Batista)

- Controller.Redirect(String) is now virtual, and it's called by all Redirect* methods (by Fabio Batista)

- Moved action collection to ControllerMetaDescriptor class, using new method that does not require ScreenCommonPublicMethods.

- Moved ControllerDescriptorBuilder creation to ProcessEngineFactory to ensure ControllerDescriptors are only created once

- ITrace and Trace property added to IRailsEngineContext (kudos to Chad Humphries)

- Hierarchy of areas support (kudos to Fabio Batista)

- Support for [Layout] attribute on Actions, so actions can override 
  the Controller's specified layout (by Fabio Batista, rev 1459)

- PaginationHelper introduced: paginates objects that implements IList, and supports caching.

- ARPager introduced: allows you to specify a custom NHibernate HQL Query or an NHibernate Criteria
  (using Expression.Eq, à là ActiveRecord's FindAll()) and fetch the results with pagination.
  (by Fabio Batista)

- Added IServerUtility.JavaScriptEscape() (kudos to Chad Humphries)

- Added DataBindAttribute.Exclude - A comma separated list of property names 
  to exclude from databinding (kudos to Chad Humphries)

- Added IResponse.BinaryWrite() and CreateCookie( HttpCookie ) overload

- Added IServerUtility.MapPath()

- Added IRailsContext.ApplicationPhysicalPath

- Added to HtmlHelper:
  - InputCheckbox
  - InputRadio
  - InputFile
  - InputButton
  - Form(action, attribtes) overload

- Added more fine-grained support for ExecuteEnum in Filters (by Fabio Batista, rev 1286-1287)

    The values are now: BeforeAction, AfterAction, AfterRendering and Always.
  
- Support for nullable types in SmartDispatcherController, useful for
  detecting missing ValueType parameters. Works with Nullables library, still
  not working on .NET 2.0 Nullables (by Fabio Batista, rev 1297 and 1363)

  Example of use:

    // .NET 1.1
    public void CreateTicket(string name, NullableDateTime date, NullableInt32 priority)
    {
      if (name == null || name.Length == 0) throw new MissingFieldException();
      if (!date.HasValue) throw new MissingFieldException();
      if (!priority.HasValue) throw new MissingFieldException();
    }

    // .NET 2.0 (NOT WORKING YET)
    public void CreateTicket(string name, DateTime? date, int? priority)
    {
      if (name == null || name.Length == 0) throw new MissingFieldException();
      if (!date.HasValue) throw new MissingFieldException();
      if (!priority.HasValue) throw new MissingFieldException();
    }

- Broaded support for Enums. They can be specified by number or by text (by Fabio Batista, rev 1203)

  public enum MyEnum {
    First = 1,
    Second = 2
  }
  
  <input type="hidden" name="myEnumValue" value="1" />
  <input type="hidden" name="myOtherEnumValue" value="seCoNd" />
  
  public void TestEnumValues(MyEnum myEnumValue, MyEnum myOtherEnumValue)
  {
    if (myEnumValue == MyEnum.First) // ok
    if (myOtherEnumValue == MyEnum.Second) // ok
  }

- Support for ActiveRecord fetching in Castle.MonoRail.ActiveRecordSupport
  (by Fabio Batista, rev. 1380).
	
	Mainly for those unconfortable with direct binding of form values
	to ActiveRecord objects. This attribute only fetches the ActiveRecord based
	on its Primary Key, nothing more.
	
	Usage:
	
		public class MyCrudExample : ARSmartDispatchController
		{
			// simple usage.
			public void Save( [ARFetch] Example example, string name, ...)
			{
				example.Name = name;
				// ...
				
				example.Save();
			}

			// using a different request parameter, instead of the action's parameter name
			public void Save( [ARFetch("primaryKey")] Example example, string name, ...)
			{
				example.Name = name;
				// ...
				
				example.Save();
			}

			// ignoring invalid primary keys
			public void Save( [ARFetch(Require=false)] Example example, string name, ...)
			{
				example.Name = name;
				// ...
				
				example.Save();
			}

			// not creating new records automatically, when the parameter is empty or null
			public void Save( [ARFetch(Create=false)] Example example, string name, ...)
			{
				if (example == null)
					example = new Example(someRequiredConstructorParameter);
				
				example.Name = name;
				// ...
				
				example.Save();
			}

			// fetching a list of Active Records
			public void Delete( [ARFetch("selected")] Example[] examples )
			{
				foreach (Example example in examples)
					example.Delete();
			}
		}

- Support for smart arrays (aside from primitives) (kudos do Ahmed)

  Quoting the explanation:
  
Suppose you have this class:

 
class Person
{
  public string Name {get;set;}

  public int Age {get;set;}
}

With the following view 

  <input name="Person[0].Name"   value="John">
  <input name="Person[0].Age"    value="30">
  <input name="Person[1].Name"   value="Mary">
  <input name="Person[1].Age"    value="25">

Now you can specify the DataBinderAttribute to an array element in your controller:

public void SavePeople( [DataBinder(Prefix=”People”)] Person[] people )
{
  // you should be able to access the people as an Person array

  Assert.IsTrue( people[0].Name == “John” );
  Assert.IsTrue( people[1].Name == “Mary” );
}

There are a couple extra things, first you can specify an “ignore” attribute to any element in which that case the data binder will completely ignore the element

  <input name="Person[0].Name"   value="John">
  <input name="Person[0].Age"    value="30">
  <input name="Person[0]@ignore" value="yes">
  <input name="Person[1].Name"   value="Mary">
  <input name="Person[1].Age"    value="25">

In the previous html code, the people array in the controller will only have one element (Mary).

Notice that I reserved the @ sign as a special character to add metadata to any element, right now the only attributes supported are “ignore” and “count”.

The count attribute serves as a performance optimization when your elements are keyed using sequential integers, for example:

  <input name="Person@count"   value="5">
  <input name="Person[0].Name" value="John">
  <input name="Person[1].Name" value="James">
  <input name="Person[2].Name" value="Jeff">
  <input name="Person[3].Name" value="Geoff">
  <input name="Person[4].Name" value="Jeffrey">

** Ajax Helper **
   
- AjaxHelper2 renamed to AjaxHelper. The old one was renamed to AjaxHelperOld

- Two more callbacks supported: onSuccess and onFailure. For example

  $AjaxHelper.BuildFormRemoteTag( $DictHelper.CreateDict("url=something.rails", "OnSuccess=myjavascriptfunction();", "OnFailure=otherfunction(request)" ) );
  
  Do not confuse it with 'success' and 'failure' keys, though. Those means the id of elements
  to be updated in the event of success and failure.


** NVelocity View Engine **
