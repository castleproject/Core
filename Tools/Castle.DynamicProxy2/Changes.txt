Beta 1 Version 1.0.0.0
======================
- Reimplemented serialization of ProxyGenerationOptions, see revision 3803, DP-59

- Added method signature filtering to MethodFinder (see MethodSignatureComparer) because there were
  still cases triggering duplicate methods

- Reimplemented serialization without default constructors, see revision 3725, DP-53
- Reimplemented serialization with delegates/events, see revision 3751, DP-56

- Renamed InterfaceProxyGeneratorWithoutTarget to InterfaceProxyWithoutTargetGenerator

- Fixed DYNPROXY-62
  "Some tests in MethodFinderTestCase failed because of culture specific exception messages"

- Implemented cache for System.Type.GetMethods() in order to avoid triggering the duplicate methods bug

- Applied Adam Tybor's patch fixing DYNPROXY-61 
  "Need GetInterceptors from IProxyTargetAccessor back for NHibernate Trunk"

- Disabled replication of internal constructors on class proxies.

- Moved the UseSingleInterfaceProxy from Core.ComponentModel to ProxyGeneratorOptions. 

- Applied Lee Henson's patch fixing generic parameter definitions

- Applied Jacob Lewallen's patch that introduces ProxyInterfaceWithTargetInterface
  Quoting

  "I've introduced a new "mode" that is
   ProxyInterfaceWithTargetInterface, that uses the given interface as
   the target type, rather than the type of the target (it asserts the
   target implements the interface) All other modes should remain the
   same.

  "In this scenario, the IInvocation will also implement
   IChangeProxyTarget, which can then be used to change the proxy target
   to another implementation of the target interface."

- Added support for events

- Fixed DYNPROXY-43
  "DP2 : Missing ParameterInfo 'Name' for Proxied methods"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-41
  "Invalid state exception on DP2"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-39
  "Deadlock in DynamicProxy2"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-28
  "Virtual methods calls from constructors are not working"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-27
  "Support for non-parameterless constructors"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-25
  "Chars returns are not properly configured"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-24
  "DynamicProxy2: missing locks"

- Fixed DYNPROXY-34
  "Cant proxy generic interfaces"
